# Urban.Grocers - API Testing & Logic Validation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the backend validation of the **Urban.Grocers** grocery delivery platform. I performed comprehensive API testing to ensure that server-side logic, data integrity, and HTTP responses meet the required specifications.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Postman:** For executing and automating API requests.
- **JSON:** For payload structure validation.
- **Microsoft Excel:** For documenting test cases and execution reports.

## 🚀 Testing Scope
- **Status Code Validation:** Ensuring correct responses (200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, etc.).
- **Body Content Analysis:** Verifying that JSON responses contain the expected data fields and types.
- **Business Logic:** Testing the "Create Basket" and "Add Products" functionalities, including edge cases like invalid product IDs or quantities.
- **Boundary Testing:** Checking system limits for product counts and user inputs.

## 📂 Documentation
The full test execution matrix, including detailed test cases, expected results, and actual outcomes, is documented in a structured report.
